# Memory Game

Notes:
- Leaderboards are persisted and stored in local storage using redux persist
- There are currently no tests, I will be adding a couple either monday evening or tuesday, but I simply didn't have time over the weekend.

Requirements:
Page 1 initial page with the game start button and ui.
Page 2 game page (with card flip animation)
The 3rd page will show the score and the game cycle will be refreshed by returning to the main menu with a button and resetting the game.

Extras:
To start the game, select username on the first page and create your scoreboard using these procedures on the last page.
